# Weather-Dashboard

The webpage consists of a weather dashboard where the user can search for the current weather and the five-day forecast of a city. When the search button is activated, the app creates a new button below the search button, which is saved as search history to check the weather in the future. However, there is a clear button which, when clicked, automatically deletes all previously search cities.
